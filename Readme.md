# 🧙‍♂️ Amine Ghandi – The UX/UI Wizard

Hey there, fellow traveler of the digital realm!  
I'm **Amine**, a self-taught **UX/UI Wizard** from Morocco 🇲🇦 conjuring clean, intuitive, and spellbinding user experiences. Armed with a magic staff (that also happens to be a stylus 🪄✍️), I blend design, code, and strategy to craft interfaces that **don’t just look good — they *feel* good**.

## 🧙‍♂️ My Gimmick

I don’t just design — I **enchant**.  
My brand is all about mixing **classic wizardry aesthetics** with **modern UI/UX principles**.  
Think of me as the Gandalf of interface design — but with fewer robes and more grids.  
In my world, creativity *is* magic.
